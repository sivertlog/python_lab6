Sivert Log
March 2025
### Lab Notes:

*All parts of this lab are located in
**vigenere_sq.py**.*

***Parts One and Two***  
These parts remain nearly identical to
what we created in class.

***Part Three(Bonus!)***  
The functions `undo_vigenere_index()` and
`decrypt_vigenere` were added to complete
part three.

***Part Four(Bonus!!)***  
Added a while loop for the menu containing:  
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
3. Change Keyword
4. View Vigen√®re Square
5. Exit Program

Also added `enter()` as a simple 'press ENTER
to continue' prompt before returning to the
main menu.
